    "# Cheminformatic reactions - definitions, usage, and applications\n",
    "`polymerist` provides a number of utilities and novel algorithms for handling chemical reactions between functional groups, which allows one to approach chemical rearrangements, especially as pertains to polymerizations, ina \"context-free\" manner; a single reaction template can be applied to an entire chemical class of molecules. these methods are useful for numberous applications, including:\n",
    "* Enumeration of polymer repeat units\n",
    "* Automatic detection of monoer-to-mechanism compatibility (synthsis pathway identification)\n",
    "* Auomatic detection of autopolymerization reactions\n",
    "* Scalable, high-throughput reaction-based workflows (scales as number of chemical classes, NOT as number of molecules)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we provide several tutorials on the reaction-related funcitonality `polymerist` supplies, including:\n",
    "* 0.1 - Setting up reaction templates from bond cycles\n",
    "* 0.2 - Tracing atoms and bonds through a reaction\n",
    "* 0.3 - forming and fragmenting reaction adducts\n",
    "* 0.4 - Generating and storing chemical fragments \n",
    "* 0.5 - Enumeration of compatible reactants via DISCERNMENT\n",
    "* 0.6 - [Performing reactions in series to enumerate all possible chemical fragments](0.6-modified_mpd_tmc_fragmentation.ipynb)"
