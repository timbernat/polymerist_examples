    "In constructing polymer systems for MD, there are a handful of core issues that one will frequently encounter:\n",
    "* When working with polymers, it is virtually always the case that the repeat units in a polymer chain are _not_ chemically identical to the corresponding monomers  \n",
    "* When setting up polymeric systems for MD, particularly for high-throughput applications, it is desirable to set up a myriad of chemically-distinct monomers which polymerize by the same mechanism\n",
    "* Finally, the [monomer fragment specification we prescribe](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c01691) can be a bit unwieldy and tough to parse, and generating these fragment template by hand is error-prone"
